## Paper Description

Evaluating individual contributions from team members is a critical challenge across many domains, such as security and team sports. While progress has been made in valuing contributions, such as target defence in security or on-ball performance in football (soccer), many aspects of performance, such as off-ball football actions, remain difficult to quantify. We introduce \textit{GAPP}, a Graph Attention Network model that predicts football pass reception probabilities and provides interpretable insights into off-ball defending. Using attention mechanisms, GAPP captures player interactions and introduces two new metrics to quantify defender contributions. We tested GAPP on 306 English Premier League matches, and showed it reduces binary cross-entropy loss by 6.4 percent compared to multiple baselines for pass reception prediction, while offering unique insights for off-ball defender evaluation for coaches, scouts and teams. This work shows the potential of graph attention networks for analysing complex multi-agent systems like football. The paper for this work was accepted for publication at IEEE DSAA 2025 and will be released soon.
